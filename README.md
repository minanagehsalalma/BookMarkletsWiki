# My Favorite Bookmarklets

A curated collection of useful and fun bookmarklets to enhance your browsing experience.

## 📚 What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small JavaScript programs stored as a URL in a browser's bookmark. When clicked, they execute the JavaScript code on the currently open web page, allowing you to perform various actions, modify content, or extract information without installing extensions.

## 🚀 How to Use Bookmarklets

Using these bookmarklets is simple:

1. **Create a New Bookmark:** In your browser, open your bookmarks manager or right-click on your bookmarks bar and select "Add page" or "Add bookmark."
2. **Name the Bookmark:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Dark Mode Toggle").
3. **Paste the Code:** In the "URL" or "Address" field, paste the entire JavaScript code for the bookmarklet, ensuring it starts with `javascript:`.
4. **Save:** Save the bookmark.
5. **Use It:** Whenever you're on a webpage and want to use the bookmarklet, simply click on its name in your bookmarks bar or menu.
