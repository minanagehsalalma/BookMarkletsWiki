## üìö What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small JavaScript programs stored as a URL in a browser's bookmark. When clicked, they execute the JavaScript code on the currently open web page, allowing you to perform various actions without installing extensions.

## üöÄ How to Use Bookmarklets

For the easiest experience, visit our **[Live Site](https://minanagehsalalma.github.io/BookMarkletsWiki/)** where you can drag and drop the bookmarklets directly to your bookmarks bar.

Alternatively, you can install them manually:

1.  **Create a New Bookmark**: In your browser, open your bookmarks manager or right-click your bookmarks bar and select "Add page" or "Add bookmark."
2.  **Name the Bookmark**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Facebook Video Downloader").
3.  **Paste the Code**: From the GitHub source, copy the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet and paste it into the URL field.
4.  **Save**: Save the bookmark.
